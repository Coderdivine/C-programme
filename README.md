## Introduction

The C-programme repository provides a range of C programs that cover different aspects of the C programming language. The programs are organized into folders based on the topic they cover, making it easy to navigate and find relevant examples. Whether you are a beginner learning C or an experienced programmer looking for reference implementations, this repository can be a valuable resource.

## Installation

To use the programs in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Coderdivine/C-programme.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:
   ```
   cd C-programme
   ```

3. Explore the folders and files to find the specific C programs you are interested in.

## Usage

To compile and run the C programs, you need a C compiler installed on your machine, such as GCC or Clang. Use the following steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the folder containing the program you want to compile and run:
   ```
   cd <folder_name>
   ```

3. Compile the program using the C compiler. For example, with GCC:
   ```
   gcc <program_name.c> -o <output_name>
   ```

   Replace `<program_name.c>` with the name of the C program file and `<output_name>` with the desired name for the compiled executable.

4. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   ./<output_name>
   ```

   Replace `<output_name>` with the name of the compiled executable.

5. Follow the prompts or observe the program's output to interact with or analyze the program's behavior.
